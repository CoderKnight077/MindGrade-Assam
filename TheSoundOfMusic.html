    How does Evelyn hear music?
  

</div>

Answer:
Evelyn lost her hearing when she was only eleven. But she didn't give up. She wanted a normal life and loved music. A percussionist named Ron Forbes noticed her talent. He told her to feel the music instead of hearing it. Evelyn learned to sense the drums' vibrations with her body. She could feel high notes in her upper body and low notes in her lower body. She described how music tingled through her skin, cheekbones, and even her hair. When she played the xylophone, she felt the sound in her fingertips. By leaning on drums or standing on a wooden floor without shoes, she could feel the vibrations flowing through her.
