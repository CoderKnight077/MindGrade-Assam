4) What do you think the last two lines of the poem mean? (Looking back, does
the poet regret his choice or accept it?)

</div>  <br> <br>

Ans:-  the last two lines of the poem reflects the courage to accept the challenge and take the right decisions in life .  The poet decided to take the right path that was less travelled by others because he wanted to do something different in his life .  no , the poet does not seem to regret his choice.  summarize the above line with more simpler words

    II. 1. Have you ever had to make a difficult choice (or do you think you will have
    difficult choices to make)? How will you make the choice (for what reasons)?

</div>
<br> <br>

Ans :- In the future, I'll have some tough decisions to make about my education and career. After finishing 10th grade, I'll need to pick which subjects to focus on, which will impact my future job options. Then, I'll have to choose between being an engineer, a doctor, or something else. I'll decide based on what I'm good at and what makes me happy, not just for money. I want a career that's fulfilling and peaceful, not just about competition. I'll pick a path that's challenging and different, like the poet in the poem.

<div class="pitol">       

    2. After you have made a choice do you always think about what might have
    been, or do you accept the reality?

</div>
 <br><br>

    Ans :-  Making decisions in life isn't always easy. Sometimes, both options seem good, or we're unsure which one is better. Still, we have to choose one. It's important to make choices based on our experiences and interests. Once a decision is made, accept it. Dwelling on a decision or regretting it isn't helpful. It stops us from being happy with what we've gained. So, it's better to stand by our decisions.

    1) Was Lencho surprised to find a letter for him with money in it?

</div>


<br>

Ans :- No ,  Lencho was not surprised to find a letter with money from God, as he believed that God would help him.



<br> <br>
<div class="pitol">

    2) What made him angry ?

</div>




    <br>


   Ans :-  When he finished counting money he found only seventy pesos in it. But he had demanded hundred pesos. He was confident that God could neither make a mistake nor deny him what he had requested. So he was pretty sure that the post office employees must have taken the remaining thirty pesos.

1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell
you this?  </div> <br>  <br>



  Ans :-   Lencho had complete faith in God. The sentences in the story that show this are as follows: (i) But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: help from God.

2.  Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the
letter ‘God’?


           </div>  <br> <br>

Ans :-  Postmaster was moved by Lencho’s strong faith in the God. So he decided to send money to Lencho. Moreover the postmaster did not want to disillusion him or shake his trust in God. So he signed the letter ‘God’. It was a good ploy to convey a message that God had himself written the letter.


  <div class="pitol">      
  
  3.  Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why/Why not?
  
  
  </div>

    <br> <br>
|
Ans :-  Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else other than him who would send him the money. His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his problem.


<br> <br>


    <div class = "pitol">

4.  Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony
in the situation? (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected
aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or amusing because it is the
opposite of what is expected.)



           </div>

    <br> <br>

Ans :-  Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the remainder of the cash as he had demanded hundred pesos from God and within the letter, there was only seventy pesos. Lencho is certain that God couldn't have made an error and hence accuses the post office employees of stealing the money. The irony during this situation is that Lencho suspects the exact same people that helped him in his time of need. He thinks that the post office employees stole his money when it's they who collected the cash for him in the first place. He calls them a “bunch of crooks” though they are the ones who tried to keep his faith in God alive by giving him money.

   5.  Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you
say he is? You may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question. 
<textarea>   greedy ,  naive ,  stupid ,  ungrateful , 
selfish ,  comical ,  unquestioning  </textarea>


</div>

<br> <br>

Ans :-   It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person. He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally lovable and different.

<br> <br> 

<div class="pitol">

6.  There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?

</div>


<br> <br> 

Ans :-  There are certainly two sorts of conflicts within the story
Conflict between humans and nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm. Lencho was expecting good rainfall to ensure a good harvest, which was the sole hope he had for his earning. He worked very hard to feed his family, but nature turned violent and destroyed everything.
Conflict between humans and humans: The story also illustrates another conflict, between humans themselves. When Lencho demanded money from God, the postmaster and therefore the other employees of the post office sent him some money, albeit they didn’t know Lencho.
However, Lencho accused them of stealing some amount of the cash . He called them “a bunch of crooks”. This shows that man doesn't have faith in another man, thereby giving rise to the present conflict. -->
